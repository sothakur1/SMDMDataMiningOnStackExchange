Rightly so in my opinion.

There are loads of choices to make after all, and most involve learning about the model class and an API for it in some framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is presented better than &quot;Here's some data, what do I do?&quot; or &quot;Give me the model?&quot; questions in that the poster is aware of some options in front of them and has a real problem that they are trying to solve themselves. However, despite trying, they have still managed to post a question that is badly framed or too broad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is at a fork in the road - either the poster could share more concrete details about what they are doing, or they could simply be encouraged to try and test their own ideas. Both could be acceptable outcomes, it is not 100% clear whether the problem needs more guidance than &quot;What I'd do is try all 3 of your ideas and test them - so why don't you do the same?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reality is that even with a lot of experience, second-guessing the best model for a problem is not how things work. Instead an expert will typically explore the data and problem, select a metric to measure success, then try a range of possible models and feature engineering, testing each.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the asker's desire is to get some help through the model selection maze. However, they tend to forget how unique each data problem often is, and/or seem to think that more experienced ML experts will somehow know what to do, sometimes only with the problem domain, a hand-waving description of the data and a rough goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd like either this question, or even a canonical duplicate, to serve as a pointer to how the posters could improve their questions so that they can be answered and/or to be a frame challenge - i.e. the experts don't just read literature looking for &quot;best solution to problem X&quot;, in fact they mostly just try and test stuff; the best thing is to learn the skills that enable the asker to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some recent example questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/18593/i-want-to-maximise-a-sum-by-selecting-best-examples-based-on-predictions-how-to&quot;&gt;I want to maximise a sum by selecting best examples based on predictions, how to model?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/18554/anomoly-detection-method-selection&quot;&gt;Anomoly detection method selection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/18510/are-deep-learning-algorithms-good-at-predicting-the-outcomes-of-sports-matches&quot;&gt;Are deep learning algorithms good at predicting the outcomes of sports matches?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="836" LastActivityDate="2020-08-11T01:41:04.153" Title="What to do about &quot;Are my model ideas for this problem good?&quot; or &quot;What is best model for this problem?&quot; questions" Tags="|discussion|" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Someone who will be responsible to promote and activate the community. Not just accepting/rejecting questions. However, I fully understand that it is just my personal view and behaviour that one should not demand from local staff members.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the ideas now&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;#1 Create useful content&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if this is the first one, it’s not the most important. We already have enough questions and answer, but it’s something we can do in parallel. When we have knowledge of something useful, but there isn’t any related question already on the site, we can ask it, wait for 2-3 days and if there isn’t any decent answer, post the answer ourselves. This is something we did in Open Data SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we achieve with this: Improve Google Ranking of DS SE and increase the traffic to our site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;#2 Reduce the number of unanswered questions&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we all try to answer 1-2 questions from the unanswered list every week, we will manage to keep it low. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we achieve with this: It’s not about the number, but make users feel that there will always be an answer for them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;#3 Guides and Tutorials&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can have community-wiki guides about specific parts of the daily routine in Data Science SE. It’s doesn’t have to be long, endless documentation. It can be in a format of QnA. For example, how should I judge if I should vote to close a question? Create a step by step guide of what a user must examine. Giving links to the Help section, adding screenshots and comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we achieve with this: We help users to contribute to the site. We don’t let them find the right way themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;#4 Special Days - Datathons&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can schedule it that once every x months, we create a community event with a specific target. For example, we will try to answer all unanswered questions with that specific Tag. We promote it inside DS Site and outside in social media. We have an open call for anyone to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we achieve with this: Participation. Any user wants to feel that is part of a bigger community. Let them feel it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;#5 Special Days - Self-promotions&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I saw it in the past in another Meta site. There is one special day every month where a user can promote a project related to Data Science in a meta question that started by a mod. It shouldn’t be a link promotion, but a short-medium post about how this project is related to DS. It’s not necessary that users will promote their own projects. They might do any interesting project they found. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we achieve with this: We create an extra bond between users and DS Site. Also, they have an extra reason to visit Meta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;#6 Chat rooms&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don’t use chat rooms at all. We don’t have to do it when there is a long comment discussion. We could have different chart rooms for different generic subjects (about Data Science) and promote the discussion there as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we achieve with this: We keep users more active during their session here&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;#7 Site promotion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I put this one last since it’s not something that anyone might want to do. Promotion of the Data Science SE in other places. Last February, I did promote the website in two big communities outside of Stack Exchange. I made it clear that the link is not an affiliate, I don’t have something to win from this and ask for specific actions. Here is a screenshot of one of the posts I did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BUGgX.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BUGgX.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that the results of those two promotions were big enough. If we check the number of questions/answers during that period we can see a change in the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWots.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWots.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those were some of the ideas I have to improve this community that we all love.

The primary goal of tags is to filter questions in an efficient way.

To fix it, someone will need to point this out, and provide them as synonyms of each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I propose that suggesting synonyms should be open to every member (with enough reputation). The reviewing process might need to be stricter but I do believe it would serve the reason tags exist in the first place more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="38887" LastActivityDate="2019-12-10T22:02:00.770" Title="Q: Should suggesting tag synonyms be more accessible?"

I'm pasting it below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm a data analyst, I studied maths and statistics and I've been working as an analyst for a year and a half. The major tools I use are R language and SQL. At the beginning I though learning Excel would be beneficial to me, so I learnt some basics of data analysis in Excel, but you know what? I find this tool useful only for these &quot;basics&quot;. Things that are more complicated usually can be done in R more efficiently. So now I treat Excel as a little helper in glancing at the data. Then I took up Python for analysis. What happened? I got to the point where I realised that there's no thing I should do in Python instead of R, because everything doable in Python can be done in R and I can do it much faster in R, because I'm more proficient. People say Python is recommendable for machine learning stuff, but in fact it is all possible in R too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, tools are just tools. If you know what to do, you should use the tools in which you can accomplish the task in the fastest and the best way. This is a sentence which I find true and it quite discourages me from learning Python and Excel. I hardly can find anything in my job which I can't do in R.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do I do in my job? The most of times I must answer a question about the business process of my company. I must collect data and then take insight into it - what caused the problem or when the problem existed. Unfortunately, I'm inexperienced and I can't answer these questions on the fly, without any prompt. I must know what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I'm interested in the most is this type of task. I would like to get better at it, be more proficient in answering to such questions + convey the data better, create better plots and write more on point conclusions. But how can I do it if not by continuing working and by accomplishing new tasks? I believe it's a thing gained with experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is more, there are tools which I've never seen in action. But even if I learn them, I won't become a proficient user because the only way of becoming really good is spend hours with the tool every day. I know it because I've been using R at the university for 3 years but only after first months of working I've encountered problems which were common, but totally non-existent in a theoretic world of R. What's my second problem with other tools? That in my job I don't feel I need a new tool. It's been quite proven by my Excel and Python experience too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course I work with other data analysts and I could ask them. The thing is that when it comes to analysing data, they use the same tools (sometimes with lower skills in tools themselves) and I see that the only thing that distinguish our abilities is experience and intuition. As I said before, I see no way to become better at it other than just working.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My problem in a nutshell: I want to explain data better, be a better data analyst in general (in order to be paid more) but don't know what I should study. I don't feel that any new programming language will help me do it. On the other hand, if I want to work somewhere else, I should first learn some technologies that I won't use in my current workplace and it means that I won't be able to learn them well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="71137" LastActivityDate="2020-03-31T09:42:41.550" Title="Is my question legal to ask on Data Science Stack Exchange?"

They can show up in the right sidebar, or in banners in question pages. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be considered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/99341/208518&quot;&gt;the Community Management Team&lt;/a&gt; to be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. The goal of this initiative is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. You may want to promote external resources, or Meta guidance for newcomers, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This initiative has an added goal of providing your community with &lt;em&gt;an opportunity to showcase exemplary questions from your main site, as well as frequently-linked-to guides from your Meta site&lt;/em&gt;. While the latter makes sense to be shown solely on this site, the former can be shown all across the network. These should avoid hot button topics, and instead focus more on evergreen questions that show what your community’s all about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. Historically, we've reset the ads every year — since this is the first run of a new format, we'll run the ads collected in this post through the end of 2021 and reassess the rotation cycle then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a previous exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Are there restrictions to the ads I can post?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All proposed ads need to abide by &lt;a href=&quot;/conduct&quot;&gt;our Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/advertising/guidelines&quot;&gt;Our ad creative guidelines&lt;/a&gt; also generally apply (note that the first 2 bullet points on the “Tracking” section do not apply, and a lot of the guidelines surrounding claims, comparisons, proof, etc., while still applicable, may not be particularly relevant). Finally, ads can not be promoting products nor soliciting programmer time or resources for: knowledge sharing or collaboration tools for technologists, or for sites where ad buyers are primarily targeting technologists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each answer must relate to a single ad submission.&lt;/strong&gt; Please do not post multiple ad submissions in the same answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers must be in one of the below formats:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have an image for the ad you want to display on this site (must be the case for ads to external sources):&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-none prettyprint-override&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Image name.

We’re going to be creating a custom site design for you that we hope will represent your subject and we want you all to really love it. You’ve been waiting almost five years and we really want to do this well. To facilitate this, we’re reaching out now to ask you for what you’d really love to see in the design and logo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't know me, I'm Catija, one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99338/who-is-on-the-community-management-team-and-what-does-it-do/99341#99341&quot;&gt;Community Managers&lt;/a&gt; here at Stack Exchange. I'm working with the design team on a project to get site designs to some of the sites that have been waiting the longest. My role here is to help share your ideas for your site design as well as any feedback you have about the design later in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;A quick history lesson about site theming&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Originally, site designs were part of the site graduation process. When a site left beta, they'd get their design. But, at the time we only had one designer who was working on designs and the designs were very specialized and often involved a lot of custom illustrations. We got into a situation where several sites were in queue for graduation but the designer didn't have the bandwidth to actually create the designs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I worked here, I asked the question -  &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257317/can-beta-sites-slated-for-graduation-get-full-site-abilities-without-site-design&quot;&gt;Can Beta sites slated for graduation get full-site abilities without site design upgrade?&lt;/a&gt; - on MSE. This kicked off several discussions within the CM team of the time and community members and the eventual decision was to implement &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263905/design-independent-graduation-is-on-for-early-september&quot;&gt;Design-independent graduation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; in September 2015. This meant that many sites were finally able to leave beta without waiting on a design - including this one!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At that time we also had much more strict guidelines for when a site &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; graduate - they had to consistently get 10 new questions per day. This level of volume made graduation impossible or very unlikely for many sites - meaning many would stay in beta forever. As such, the CM team considered another request I made - &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303727/lets-break-up-with-graduation-and-remove-a-bunch-of-beta-labels&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#39;s break up with &amp;quot;Graduation&amp;quot; and remove a bunch of &amp;quot;Beta&amp;quot; labels&lt;/a&gt; - and that's what eventually happened, too. In 2019, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/331708/congratulations-to-our-29-oldest-beta-sites-theyre-now-no-longer-beta&quot;&gt;removed the beta label from 29 sites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/374096/congratulations-to-the-59-sites-that-just-left-beta&quot;&gt;another 59 in December 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've also gone through several design systems changes, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/04/26/episode-436-meet-the-design-system-that-lets-us-customize-and-theme-stack-overflow/&quot;&gt;launching Stacks version 1.0&lt;/a&gt;, which make creating and building in designs much simpler for both our design team and the developers. In fact, we showed off how flexible it could be in our April Fools prank this year &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/05/12/an-unfiltered-look-back-at-2022-april-fools/&quot;&gt;Filters for Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What to expect&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, we'll be communicating with you about your site design, so please help us out as much as you can. While we may not be experts in data science, we know that you are and that you have great ideas about what you want this site to look like - so share them with us! You've got a week now to pool up your thoughts in answers to this question, at which point I'll pass them off to the designer working on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They'll spend some time working on a design based on your guidance, and we'll be back when it's ready to show you what the design and logo look like. At that point, y'all will have a week to make suggestions for adjustments to the design. Our hope is that there will be little that needs adjusting but, due to the size of our backlog, we can't allow more than one phase of feedback, so any changes will need to be recommended at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We'll then consider the changes proposed and make any adjustments that we feel are beneficial. Changes that are too big or are out of scope likely won't be possible, but we'll make sure to explain why we opted against making a change should that happen. Please understand that design is often a subjective thing and we may end up with community members differing in their opinions, so we'll be taking that into account when deciding. Decisions about the final design will be made by the design team and CMs with the concerns of the community taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it's worth keeping in mind that the goal of these designs is to make something topical, unique, and attractive, but we'll be designing within the scope of our newer site theming. We'll be able to create a logo, background colors, and textures in addition to your logo - but please don't expect illustrations like what you may have seen on some of the older site designs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the next month or so, we’ll be going through a few steps to get your site design up and running. This post is the first of those steps. I’ll also be using this post to track the phases in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&quot;s-table-container&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;table class=&quot;s-table&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Step&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;Information Gathering&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;complete&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;Design V1&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;complete&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;V1 Feedback&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2626/site-design-and-logo-draft&quot;&gt;complete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;Design adjustments (if needed)&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;complete&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;Developer cleanup and shipping of final design&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2631/new-design-launched&quot;&gt;complete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we need from you&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I've mentioned already, we need some inspiration from you so that we can get started on this design and create something you'll really be proud of. I poked around and found a discussion or two about when a design might happen but I wasn't able to find any existing discussions about logo or site designs that had much in the way of ideas, but if I've missed them, please link them in a comment so we can find them. We're really looking for design ideas rather than needing you to design anything for us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you're answering this question, think about:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What symbols or images are important to the subject of this site?&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Especially things that speak to insiders that we might not find on our own&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are there any colors that are tied to your subject?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What tone/mood/feeling would you like your theme to emit? While this is subjective, it helps to set some design guardrails. So, when answering your thoughts, some good axes to mention are where the theme might sit inside these spectra&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From fun to serious&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From classic to modern&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From simple to complex&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How could a good logo represent your subject?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What are things to avoid?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, let me know! We're really looking forward to hearing from you and getting your site design underway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="43359" LastEditorUserId="123591" LastEditDate="2022-08-10T18:24:45.737" LastActivityDate="2022-08-10T18:24:45.737" Title="Custom Data Science design and logo - Information gathering" Tags="|discussion|design|" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="2" FavoriteCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Sponsors work alongside our communities who ultimately build these sites. Communities ask the questions; communities create the tags; communities conduct elections as they do now, and we are not renaming our current sites like a garish sport stadium to the highest bidder. Any ads a sponsor submits still have go through our crazy-strict ad editorial process… as it has always been. Companies do not have access to personal data, and all Q&amp;amp;A content remains irrevocably licensed under Creative Commons for sharing and attribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sponsorships are a tool that our clients can use to let folks who would be interested in their products know about them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What if I think I've found a design glitch/bug?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If something looks off, please report it as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bug&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'bug'&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; so we can investigate and squash it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's it! If you have any other questions or concerns, please leave them as answers below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And lastly, thank you.

As we wave goodbye to last year and welcome the new one, we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion&quot;&gt;a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As most of you here might be aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;-- &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;A Theory of Moderation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't eliminate the need for having &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/&quot;&gt;moderators&lt;/a&gt; altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks — folks like you. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference in ensuring Stack Exchange sites remain a valuable source of high-quality content on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as we say goodbye to 2023 (and January 2024… ahem) and move into 2024, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmN7M.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;exciting&lt;/em&gt; stats&lt;/a&gt;.

indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁶ Includes close flags (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; close or reopen votes).

I felt this was a valid and thoughtful question, but the reception I got felt very cold and dismissive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only (remaining) responses I received insisted that I needed to determine in advance how I would analyze the data, before I could decide how to structure that data. This contradicts my belief in the possibility (and utility) of canonical data formats. I understand that it's possible to optimize data layout in support of some particular analysis (or other usage); however I don't want to tightly-couple my data to some preconceived methodology. I want to represent my dataset with high fidelity to my common-sense, everyday human conception of that data, build up a comprehensive knowledge graph as a durable corpus resource, and then develop different algorithms to analyze it. I want to accumulate my knowledge over time as a cumulative dataset in a machine-programmable format. I don't want to fracture my datasets into disparate representations, because the underlying use case is the same: summarizing different perspectives about the same facts, and evaluating comparative strength of those perspectives based on available evidence. I want to model they way I reason about my beliefs, and those of others, so I can build a tool to help me advocate my perspective more vigorously, using evidence I accumulate and systematically encode over time in a database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is this site (datascience.stackexchange.com) a better place to ask such questions?

Clearly, in a strict interpretation, we would flag this as &amp;quot;Not an Answer&amp;quot; and it would likely be deleted. However, this question was clearly germane to the subject at hand, was subsequently upvoted, and ultimately answered by another user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difficulty here is that one response would be to flag this &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; and simply ask the user to ask their question again as a standalone question. The problem with this is that since it is so related to the initial question that was asked, I am not sure that it could survive in isolation. Moreover, there has got to be some benefit to the community by leaving this, if say, the initial answer, while upvoted, was initially not clear or if another user had a similar question. In this sense, the ability to ask a follow up question can have significant utility on the platform. As it currently stands however, this may not be the correct way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts? What is the correct action here?

Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as we welcome 2021, and in keeping with tradition, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/pU1Al.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;exciting&lt;/em&gt; stats&lt;/a&gt;.

being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;³ A &amp;quot;destroyed&amp;quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. &lt;a

spam.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁵ Includes close flags (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; close or reopen votes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Further reading:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

Belated as it is, it’s time for a refresh of &lt;strong&gt;Community Promotion Ads&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;interesting blogs and resources related to data science&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

I've been active on a few other SE sites for some time and one can really tell the difference. Apparently there's just not enough regular active members for the flow of questions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackexchange.com/sites#technology&quot;&gt;68% answered&lt;/a&gt;). Crucially there are very few votes being cast, and this is quite bad given that the SE model relies on votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate my point: I gave 50 answers in the past two months, half of which have zero votes. In average I collected probably around 0.5 votes per answer (not counting OP's choice; without any negative vote as far as I know). I don't mind as long as I enjoy giving some insight here and there, but with very little feedback from the community it's not very encouraging and I guess I'll eventually get bored with the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what I'd like to know is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why so few people vote?&lt;/strong&gt; Is it because there are not enough &quot;avid members&quot;, too much turn-over, too many questions, questions being too specialized (or not enough)... ?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can be done about it?

But of course that's not very welcoming.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;be more strict about duplicates: many beginners questions are variants of existing questions, should I vote to close as duplicate even if it's not exactly the same question?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;any other suggestion...?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="64377" LastActivityDate="2019-07-17T17:34:43.313" Title="Why so few people vote and is there any way to encourage voting?"

As a moderator your close vote is binding. So, voting to close will close the question regardless of how the community at large has received the question. Many people think that closing questions is harsh and should only be used in the most extreme cases. Others think that closing questions that meet the closing guidelines is one of the main methods to keep question quality high. So this question centers on discussing how you will use your moderator close vote powers and how you have recently used the powers you currently have. Please discuss your views on this. Points that should be addressed include: How do you expect you will use the moderator close vote power? Will you visit the close vote queue regularly and vote to close those questions that need closing? How many close votes have you done in the last year? How many close vote reviews have you done in the last year? Do you consider closing a question unwelcoming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important responsibilities of a moderator is being on the site regularly. Moderators are expected to visit the site regularly and go to the moderator queues and then maybe also the review queues. How often do you visit DataScience or other StackExchange sites during a day or week?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective moderation requires a desire to generate high quality content. One aspect of quality content is clear grammar and formatting. To that end, editing is an important activity. Please discuss how you approach the task of content editing. Some things to consider: How many edits have you done on the site (or on other SE sites) in the last year or two? How many suggested edits have you reviewed on the site (or on other SE sites) in the last year or two?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many moderating activities that the someone who is not a Diamond Moderator can do such as voting, editing, flagging, and visiting the reviews queues. Visiting the reviews queues is the activity farthest removing from visiting the site simply to ask or answer questions. In the last year or two, how active have you been in the review queues? How do you see yourself fostering a helpful community of people with review queue privileges (who aren't mods)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's the most helpful post/answer you've seen on this site?

And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of &lt;strong&gt;Community Promotion Ads&lt;/strong&gt;! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;interesting blogs and resources related to data science&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction [..]. DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, and more dependable releases, in close alignment with business objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Science&lt;/strong&gt; - Data science is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured [..].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's consider two cases. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;interesting blogs and resources related to data science&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it.

Whereas data science is directly the manipulation of data in order to produce tools to make something better (image detection, intrusion detection, etc.). The separation is very blurry and I do not think that intelligence can exist without information/data, and its manipulations. However, most machine learning and deep learning demonstrated are simply conducting complex function approximations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, due to the popularization of machine learning and especially deep learning, the manipulation of data has created the impression of intelligent machine due to it being capable of competing with human performance in very targeted tasks (object recognition, segmentation, etc.). Evidently, the name artificial intelligence catches people's attention much more than data science or machine learning. Thus, it is common for news which is essentially generic data science/machine learning to be called artificial intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is further demonstrated on the Artificial Intelligence site where the majority of the questions are pertaining more to data science and machine learning than truly discussing possibilities, methods or emerging work pertaining to machines capable of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29587" LastActivityDate="2018-03-25T23:13:59.073" Title="Should this site be combined with the Artificial Intelligence stack exchange?"

I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2309/community-moderator-election-has-been-cancelled&quot;&gt;this meta post&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the source of the problem and determine when, if at all, should the election be rebooted. The responses mostly came in three forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a lack of awareness that there was an election. This is both folks saying that they weren't actually aware, or that they figured that others who might run were not aware. We will look into things which can help improve awareness if the election is restarted. That said, Meta is an essential part of governance and moderation on a site. With several posts on the topic of the election (the initial announcement, two separate posts on the Q&amp;amp;A, and the extension announcement itself), a separate concern comes up with the lack of overlap in “People who might be interested in moderating” and “People who pay attention to Meta and the status of the election”. Which brings us to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who are standing up now, are only hesitantly doing so on account of the shortage of candidates. While a hesitant candidate is better than no candidate, it doesn't paint a good picture if the only people standing up are those reluctantly doing so because not enough people are &lt;em&gt;motivated&lt;/em&gt; to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's people who actively and frontforwardfacingly are &lt;em&gt;disinterested&lt;/em&gt; in the prospect. Two such statements were put forth, and it concerns me more because these are relatively high rep users. One noted that there's too much overlap with Cross Validated, while the other finds the current quality of the site to be too poor for interest in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dawny33, one of the candidates who stood up during the initial nomination phase, had this to say in response to one of the posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And, this is exactly why it needs more users to be involved in moderation and helping the site, as it grew in volume at a very impressive rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we don't just need users to be merely involved in the moderation of the site - we need users to have a &lt;em&gt;vested interest&lt;/em&gt; in being involved. And I can't say that we're particularly seeing that here. By the volume of question traffic here, we certainly have a topic space - that's what helped qualify you folks for graduation in the first place. But that topic space is as needing of moderators as it is of experts to answer questions. Absent that, it may well be better off folded into one of the larger sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this is our call for action here. A site isn't held atop the pillar of a couple individuals - there may only be three moderators to be elected in an initial election, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;moderation is a job distributed across the community&lt;/a&gt;. I don't want to see people stepping up sheepishly suggesting that they might have enough time to spare. I want to see that there are people who don't just care about this topic but care about &lt;em&gt;this site&lt;/em&gt; and making it &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;. And I want to see &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; of these people. If that’s you, then now’s your chance to speak up, step up, and start moderating: voting, flagging, editing, identifying and discussing thorny issues when they present themselves. Demonstrate that you have the community that can support the high volume question base that you've accumulated, and stand on your own as a site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="140" LastActivityDate="2017-08-31T18:34:49.687" Title="Hands-on Moderation is essential for this community to continue" Tags="|discussion|moderation|" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

As &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2298/moderator-election-we-need-more-candidates&quot;&gt;explained previously&lt;/a&gt;, in order for an election to proceed to voting phases it is required that there is at least one more candidate than there are spaces remaining in the election. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is important for a variety of reasons. The first is that it allows the election process to proceed in a way that allows candidates to be evaluated before being elected. It also serves to indicate that there are enough people in the community who are willing to handle the responsibilities of overseeing moderation. While only a certain number of moderators will actually be elected, the full moderation of a site is done by a lot more than just the moderators alone. An election that thus fails to receive enough candidates, implies a shortage of interest in moderation effort on the site. As this is the site's graduation election, this is very much not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of flags on Data Science are handled currently by a single moderator. This isn't a testament to the size of the queue (as, befitting a site that passed metrics for graduation, this site is moderately active), but because there is only one moderator actively performing the duty. Normally this would call for replacement pro tem moderators to be appointed by us. However, as we believed Data Science to have activity and reputation levels fit for supporting an election, we figured that holding a proper election would handle the task well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this was not a successful endeavor. In the first week, only two candidates nominated until the very end of the nomination phase. An entire week went by without anyone new nominating. Sean Owen mentioned several names in the community who could consider running, but among the ones who still visit the site regularly, none answered the call. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this stage it's important for us to figure out what the core issue here is. Are people unaware that there's an election going on and that there are these meta posts popping up? Are people open to the idea of running, but didn't choose to do so because they were expecting others to run? Was there genuinely no interest, whether it is by not having the bandwidth to perform the duties or by not desiring to partake in those duties? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="140" LastActivityDate="2017-08-22T17:56:10.480" Title="Community Moderator Election has been cancelled" Tags="|discussion|election|" AnswerCount="5" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Starting today, you'll receive the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will have an election for community moderators - we currently have a somewhat backed up election schedule that got bumped a bit, so your election is currently set to begin collecting questions on &lt;strong&gt;July 24th&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will no longer see the &quot;beta&quot; label attached to your site's name&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will become eligible for question migration paths with the rest of the network&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will soon be able to select your own community ads.

We shouldn't &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; dismiss such questions as outside the scope of a community explicitly intended for those who have a personal or professional interest in just such a discussion, on the basis that not every data scientist is also an ethicist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would argue that the best answers to such questions are more likely to be informed by professional experience in the field of data science than by any other experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every profession that involves interaction with customers or the public demands that its members spend some time during their careers thinking about ethics. Professional organizations have ethical standards and perform ethical inquiries; certification and licensure exams include ethical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, how many people with careers unrelated to the field of data science are obligated to spend time &quot;exercising their data science muscle?&quot; It may be that the best answers to these questions will come from someone who is both an ethicist and a data scientist, but we're probably more likely to find that person here than on a general ethics site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; no ethics site in the SE network - ethics questions currently belong to philosophy.SE.

Perhaps at such time as there is a professional ethics site in the network, we could revisit this question, but for now I think it's in our best interest to &lt;strong&gt;treat ethics questions as on-topic, but migrate them to closely related sites like opendata.SE or security.SE on a case-by-case basis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="322" LastEditorUserId="322" LastEditDate="2014-06-18T19:35:14.720" LastActivityDate="2014-06-18T19:35:14.720" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Tag wikis are designed to hold useful information and aren't held to the same standards as Q&amp;amp;A on either main or meta sites. But there are a few obstacles to that approach:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What tag do you put it in? If it's a coherent set of resources, it should be stored in a central location. (In our case this isn't that big a problem since we have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/education&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;education&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; tag already in use that could serve this purpose.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's generally accepted that very few users ever read tag wikis -- and there's no great way around this except to refer to the resource as frequently as you can justify in the course of other posts and comments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Users need a lot more reputation to freely edit tag wikis than they would need to edit a community wiki answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maintenance and outreach are &lt;em&gt;a ton of work&lt;/em&gt;. This is an obstacle for any approach to collecting a list of resources. You need a core group that's willing to keep links working, add new resources as they become available and update/remove old ones as they change or disappear.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're really committed to making this work, I would advise you to start building your resource list in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/education&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;education&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; tag wiki, and use this meta discussion (or a fresh one) as a place to organize your efforts. There is a long tradition of organizing things like retagging and queue-reduction efforts on meta, so such a post would be legitimate, and also give you an idea of whether this community is ready to take on the effort you're suggesting (remember, it's going to also put demands on reviewers to approve the suggested wiki edits) at this point in the public beta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time has made a liar of me; today I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/q/388242/2359271&quot;&gt;this list of C++ reference books on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;.

Some important things to note:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Between the question and answer, these wikis have been edited &lt;em&gt;over 100 times by over 50 different users&lt;/em&gt;. Even if we take into account that this is over a period of nearly six years, that's a lot of continuing upkeep for one question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's tagged FAQ, which suggests that there's an &lt;strong&gt;identified demand&lt;/strong&gt; that this resource satisfies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's double-wiki and under &lt;strong&gt;collaborative lock&lt;/strong&gt; to make sure that the greatest number of users are able to pitch in without creating a mess of competing answers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It has been contributed to (and heavily reorganized) by community moderators and some of the highest-rep users on SO, all of whom have greatly expanded moderation tools at their disposal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Despite the continued effort to maintain that particular question, it was created a long time ago.

We have only three non-moderator users who can approve tag wiki edits and our main challenge right now is to grow our community and expand our core content.

Personal opinion but it's time to express it. I was very active and excited when it was first lunched but I didn't want to invest time and effort to a site that from early on it was obvious it will end up to the described situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first reason is simple: people without enough experience don't get what is different about the (overloaded) term data science compared to programming or statistics. Or between DS.se compared to SO or CV. The difference is not on the topics covered by the questions asked. It is about how the engineering and stats should work together when you need to build a solution to a problem. For example, when I ask the question &quot;How can I measure the mean value?&quot; I expect an answer with a simple formula in CV, or the description of a simple algorithm in SO. In DS I would expect to see an answer on how this can be solved efficiently in a Hadoop cluster, or how it can be estimated in sub-linear time by sampling and so on... I expect answers typically not found or discussed in either CV or SO. Nevertheless, people in here were ready to flag questions off-topic based on the keywords used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a simplified example, but I hope you get the point. If you don't get the point then this lead us to the second reason... The quality of the questions AND the answers was very low (I stopped checking at all the last few months, I assume  it didn't get much better).

Also, I have seen few good questions that are answered again by people who don't get the difference between DS/SO/CV leading to naif/low quality answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above are my personal opinion and if you disagree, I am sorry but I don't have the energy or time to change your mind (so don't expect me to answer back).

We all knew about the overlap from the start and I agree with &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/a/113/322&quot;&gt;iliasfl's point&lt;/a&gt; that users should be able to expect very different types of answers when asking a question that's on-topic on multiple sites, depending on where they choose to ask. The root of the problem in my view is that too many questions like these are being treated as appropriate/acceptable content:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/1151/322&quot;&gt;Prerequisites for Data Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/41/322&quot;&gt;Is the R language suitable for Big Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/778/322&quot;&gt;Is Python suitable for big data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/253/322&quot;&gt;Do I need to learn Hadoop to be a Data Scientist?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/334/322&quot;&gt;What do you think of Data Science certifications?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/793/322&quot;&gt;Uses of NoSQL database in data science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying every one of these questions should clearly be closed or that any of them necessarily deserve downvotes, but &lt;em&gt;questions like these&lt;/em&gt; at some point came to represent a major portion of the site's content. I used to come read through the new questions here every day (when I had more free time) and I definitely started to feel like the noise was overwhelming the signal. That's &lt;em&gt;really bad&lt;/em&gt; for a site that has yet to establish itself; it's a strong disincentive for attracting and retaining expert users at a time when building a strong user base is most critical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not the &lt;em&gt;naiveté&lt;/em&gt;  of these questions that makes them bad content – beginners are perfectly capable of asking thought-provoking, well-researched, non-trivial questions. For that matter, even a &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt; question can make for good content, provided it's well-defined and difficult to answer through secondary research (or the answer is simply not available online).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main problem with these questions is that they don't fit the format of the network, which isn't something to be taken lightly. The Q&amp;amp;A format of Stack Exchange is a purposeful and central part of its design that has evolved over the years to better support that &quot;repository of useful and accurate answers&quot; mission. We discourage questions like the above – primarily by closing them – because &lt;em&gt;they hurt that mission&lt;/em&gt;. To quote from Jeff's blog entry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/optimizing-for-pearls-not-sand/&quot;&gt;Optimizing For Pearls, Not Sand&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It’s true that you can’t have Q&amp;amp;A without &lt;em&gt;questions&lt;/em&gt;, but having the&#xA;  wrong sorts of questions is far more dangerous. The fastest way to&#xA;  kill any Q&amp;amp;A site is to flood it with low-quality questions....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in our case it's not that we're being flooded with terrible, awful, no-good, very bad questions. These aren't questions nobody should ever ask, anywhere; they're questions that are of &lt;em&gt;practically no interest&lt;/em&gt; to the community of experts that we need to attract in order to generate &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; high-quality content that in turn attracts &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; questions and &lt;strong&gt;builds and retains momentum for a young site&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the major flaw with the position that some have held throughout this beta that since we lack content, we should be less choosy about what content is acceptable. Actually, I think the opposite is true in a beta – the less content we have, the less signal we have, and the more important it is to weed out the noise. It's only by being choosy and scoping the site &lt;em&gt;with the ultimate goals in mind&lt;/em&gt; that we send the message to the expert community: &lt;em&gt;Stick around because this place is growing into something worthwhile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is closely related to the conclusion of the aforementioned blog post:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Answers are the real unit of work in any Q&amp;amp;A system. Therefore, the&#xA;  only logical thing to do is to &lt;strong&gt;maximize the happiness and enjoyment of&#xA;  answerers&lt;/strong&gt;. If this means aggressively downvoting or closing unworthy&#xA;  and uninteresting questions, so be it. Without a community of people&#xA;  willing to &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; questions, it really doesn’t matter if there are&#xA;  questions at all, does it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to whether the site is &quot;dying&quot;... I think it would be a mistake to think that any beta is &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;, if only we have the right policies or cast the right votes. But it may be that DataScience.SE is a particularly hard site to build, at least at the present time. The field itself is very interdisciplinary and very young; how many people really think of themselves as data science experts? Or think of their problems specifically as data science problems?

So, dealing with his/her problems in chat with the mods and other contributors is the ideal way forward.  However, I am a big believer of the Be Nice policy of SE.

So any question is welcome as long as they are &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt; which I write about bellow. We will be happy if we can motivate newbies to learn more and improve their theoretical and practical answers for sure!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But there is a BUT!!! No one can deny the recent raise of &quot;let's be a Data Scientist&quot; and I believe massive popularity usually reduces the intellectual properties of concepts. This has happened to Data Science recently and it's a good approach to protect the scientific soul of the field by editing and improving answers and questions instead of ignoring them. We can help keeping the scientific aspect of the field this way. For example:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the question is not clear, &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/18167/clustering-multiple-networks/18178#18178&quot;&gt;then make it clear&lt;/a&gt;. If it's very basic then be happy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9758/overfitting-underfitting-with-data-set-size/9760#9760&quot;&gt;we can clarify fundamental concepts&lt;/a&gt;. If it contains a misunderstanding of a concept, &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9038/purpose-of-visualizing-high-dimensional-data/9126#9126&quot;&gt;then we should correct it&lt;/a&gt;.

Let's keep it as a massive collection of QA in the field so filtering questions and answers out is the opposite way! We need to &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt; them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Do you think code debugging-help style questions are on-topic on this site?

For ex: &lt;code&gt;Why is my code not running?&lt;/code&gt; style questions vs &lt;code&gt;Why is this module not taking this hyperparameter?&lt;/code&gt; style questions. And so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Absolutly yes! They are on-topic as long as they are prog. questions related to DS. It's great that we can act like between theory and practice. And coding sometimes pains! We can help each other to save much time by answering coding questions. The other point is that it enriches the archive characteristic of SE by keeping questions in different aspects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deciding about the scope is not easy because there is no border. I would say any coding question showing up &lt;strong&gt;in a DS project&lt;/strong&gt; is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What types of questions are on-topic for Data Science but not Cross Validated, or vice versa? or, what types of questions are on-topic for both?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is a must to have Cross-Validated, then I have a concrete answer for this question which was my question as well. DS-related fields are heavily based on Statistics plus the fact that a huge part of Data Analysis is actually Statistics itself. So I would say Statistics-related questions in DS field better to go on Cross-Validated and the other parts here. A concrete example is PCA algorithm. I would say if someone has question about calculating Covariance matrix we can say $X^TX$ here. But if someone asks &quot;&lt;em&gt;Why $X^TX$ can be used as Cov matrix?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; the math explanation can be in Cross-Validated.&#xA;I would like to mention that at the end of the day I wouldn't mind combining both sites actually! (I even recommend it and I have a reason for that)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see any problem in this user!

You just make your comment about it.

I think it's a bunch of experts who &lt;strong&gt;maintain the quality&lt;/strong&gt; of DSSE not a team of dictators who think anyone should ask/answer a question in the way they like. Diversity of minds is the only treasure we have here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

Being a moderator is about maintaining the quality of everything but having high-rep may even mean a huge passion in the field without feeling responsibility! There is a different between the star of a football team and the manager! None of them does (and is supposed to do) the job of other one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope my answers helps making decision :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8878" LastActivityDate="2017-08-10T08:40:04.303" CommentCount="11" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

They are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be about refining details of a question or answer. Most often they are used to ask someone writing a question to add more details, or clarify some part of the question. On answers they might be a suggested correction or extension. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should bear in mind that comments can get deleted, purely because they are &quot;just comments&quot;. Some Stack Exchange sites do this routinely, with the admins cleaning up old comments as a matter of course. Data Science does not do this, but might change to doing it at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Or hang out in chat and post an occasional message if I see something I've had issues with before/know how to fix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That should be fine. Chat is more open-ended and can be social. Chat rooms spring up for various reasons - most commonly if comments start getting extended. On busy sites, chat often has constant ongoing discussion. On Data Science, we are not so busy in 2017 that you will find lots of chat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Any ideas how to get past this without posting bogus questions? Or how to get at least 20 rep for chat? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Posting bogus questions is likely to lose you rep and will be counter-productive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quickest way to get 20 rep is to write high quality content in a question or answer. That can be relatively short, and you could pick an easy-to-answer question. Look carefully at the style of answers that get up-voted. They are not chatty, they don't extend questions with &quot;that's interesting, I also found that...&quot;, they don't just link to possible answers off-site - these things are the norm on most social media and forums, but not here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have 6 months to live due to a degenerative disease in my spine and I've been trying to learn random things to take my mind off of it&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's a tough break. I hope you have a good support network around you. Stack Exchange sites, for better or worse, cannot really take this sort of thing into account. In some ways this is internet Nirvana - they don't care what age, sex, religion, you are, or what you are like physically. In other ways it is impersonal and unforgiving, because Stack Exchange &lt;em&gt;does care&lt;/em&gt; about the quality of your writing and choice of subject matter, and you will be judged for it constantly in questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a community with an open friendly atmosphere to chat and share ideas, then Stack Exchange is not really it. Not that people are not friendly here, just that the atmosphere is more business like and focused around content production. It has more in common with Wikipedia than an machine learning forum. On the plus side the focus on getting good questions and answers is a great learning resource. On the minus side, it's not a place to make friends. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest, in addition to finding a niche for yourself in Stack Exchange, that you look at other places with a more social atmosphere. Depending on what learning challenges you set yourself, you might find taking part in a free MOOC course will be fun - one classic machine learning course is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Andrew Ng's Machine Learning on Coursera&lt;/a&gt; and a new cohort will be starting soon.

Thanks for bringing it to meta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Question(s):&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am going to summarize your question into two major points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should we try to avoid creation of tags if another tag will work?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How aggressively should we curate tags?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yes, if you are contributing content, then try to avoid creation of tags if another tag will work.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You should not &lt;em&gt;aggressively&lt;/em&gt; curate tags.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I put in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/a&gt; because I am afraid I will be somewhat long winded here.  Please bear with me while I do some exposition to build context, and hopefully establish &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I think the above is true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Who needs to find the questions via tags?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Primarily answerers.  Non-answerers are most likely to find the the questions and answers they are looking for via a web search engine.  But answerers, the bread and butter of stack exchange, will often follow tags to help find questions to answer.  So removing a superfluous minor tag is not nearly as important as getting an appropriate tag affixed.  For the same reason, an incorrect tag, should be removed so as not to provide a false positive to those same answerers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Things to be aware of when editing:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edits without the edit privilege (suggested edits) require someone else’s attention.  One of the reject reasons for suggested edits is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no improvement whatsoever&lt;/strong&gt; This edit does not make the post even a little bit easier to read, easier to find, more accurate or more accessible. Changes are either completely superfluous or actively harm readability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edits drive posts to the front page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So while edits are good, annoying answerers with a lot of churn on the front page is not good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These two things mean;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Try to make your edits count&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally try to fix any problems with the post when you are editing it.  This is especially relevant if you come to the post to edit the tags. Don't simply replace a tag and move on. Take a moment to cleanup anything else that the posts needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On sites in which I have the edit privilege, I will freely make very small edits to new posts, but as the post ages, will need to see a better reason than something small. But this also means that for posts that have been recently answered, or had other activity that drives them to the front page, I might then take the time to fix smaller things, since they have already been bumped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why tags as an organizing tool?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tags are very flexible and easy for the user to use. They are easily created in a distributed fashion, and have been shown to generally converge toward consistent meaning within a community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are however a couple of disadvantages, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)#Advantages_and_disadvantages&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;... the resulting metadata can include &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;homonyms&lt;/a&gt; (the same tags used with different meanings) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;synonyms&lt;/a&gt; (multiple tags for the same concept), which may lead to inappropriate connections between items and inefficient searches for information about a subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Synonyms&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Atwood had a blog post a few years back describing the Whys and Whats of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/08/01/tag-folksonomy-and-tag-synonyms/&quot;&gt;tag synonym system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/suggest-tag-synonyms&quot;&gt;official page&lt;/a&gt; has this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Users with more than 1250 reputation and a total answer score of 5 or more on the tag, can suggest tag synonyms. Users with a total answer score (total upvotes minus total downvotes) of 5 or more on the tag, can vote for tag synonyms. Suggestions will be automatically approved when they reach a score of 4, and automatically deleted when they reach a score of -2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/suggest-tag-synonyms&quot;&gt;tag synonyms&lt;/a&gt; at 1250 reputation (2500 on graduated sites) if you have an answer score of at least 5 in the tag.  But we don't have a lot of users that meet this criteria, so to date this has been a moderator (Sean) activity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;When to use Meta?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meta is about giving the community a place to ask and answer question about the site.  Via voting on these things, it gives the community an opportunity to weigh in on things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meta questions on SO for tags are really about largely deployed tags, when they need to be made more specific or maybe have attracted lots of misuse so should be edited out and then have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/03/24/redesigned-tags-page/&quot;&gt;tag wiki&lt;/a&gt; give advice on what the tags should be used or for...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Homonyms, once they get to be a big enough problem, should likely be dealt with in Meta.  These sorts of discussions would likely benefit from the community getting a chance to weigh in on how best to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;One more thought about removing small tags.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally think trying to remove small tags (that are not obviously in error) that have been used more than a few times, is fighting against the tide.  Some things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All tags started with a list of 1 post.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Someone thought the tag relevent (someone else may also).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Since we are somewhat catering to answerers, and they are following tags, small use tags are likely not a big enough problem to warrant editing a post.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29575" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-16T11:08:39.710" LastActivityDate="2017-12-04T00:43:17.707" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

General API or scrapping questions shouldn't belong to data science, something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53973423/getting-value-after-button-click-with-beautifulsoup-python&quot;&gt;general BeautifulSoup questions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6456304/scrapy-unit-testing&quot;&gt;general Scrapy questions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Open data is mostly for data source requests so data mining and code don't really belong there. I guess questions about the correct use of APIs would be relevant there as well as on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Programming questions should follow the same approach in my opinion. Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Keras, etc. are the most commonly used libraries in data science and there will be naturally questions related to them. As long as the question is related to a problem in: processing data, training-testing models, visualization of data and models, storing models and data, ensembles, etc. they should be seen as on-topic. This can be exemplified by: &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/40477/keras-sequential-cnn-for-image-data-reshaping-data-issues&quot;&gt;keras Sequential CNN for image data reshaping data issues&lt;/a&gt; here a question about how code is directly related to a problem in CNNs and reshaping of data (pre-processing). R is mostly used for data science, ML and statistics and not for much more so it's hard to find an unrelated question in R in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I think it is an interesting proposal for expansion in my opinion are questions about &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/43003/keras-neural-network-entirely-different-results-on-two-different-hardwares-one/43019#43019&quot;&gt;doing data science in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;, like, in AWS instances or VPSs. My guess is that more and more people will find problems specific to the use of cloud services and still will be related to data science. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13023" LastActivityDate="2018-12-30T01:11:09.457" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I am slow to use the close option because it just doesn't set a good tone for the community and will ultimately hinder our growth. I understand that this may result in some questions that will require extra moderation. But we have to accept the current state of the data science field and work with it, not against it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;One of the most important responsibilities of a moderator is being on the site regularly.

My participation has mostly been in (1) answering questions and providing help to new users and (2) helping out in the moderation cues, including the tag wikis (can you believe we didn't have a &quot;pip&quot; tag!?!? I added that). I will also add a question from time to time but nearly all of my reputation score is from helping others on this site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Effective moderation requires a desire to generate high quality content. One aspect of quality content is clear grammar and formatting. To that end, editing is an important activity. Please discuss how you approach the task of content editing. Some things to consider: How many edits have you done on the site (or on other SE sites) in the last year or two? How many suggested edits have you reviewed on the site (or on other SE sites) in the last year or two?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that edits are a double-edged sword. While this site is in English and many users are based in the US, we cannot allow ourselves to have a narrow view. Quite frankly, some of the edits that I see in the cues are disrespectful to non-English speakers. So, I think that editing requires a measured approach with the understanding that data science has people from diverse backgrounds working in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would give them increased responsibility on the site. The responsibility for this site also brings accountability and focus. If the knowledge of the user really helps the site, then the answer isn't to admonish them, the answer is to create more accountability so that their actions can help the site in a positive manner. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would encourage all mods to close questions only under the most extreme circumstances. Closing questions leaves a &quot;bad taste in the mouth&quot; and that is a user that we are unlikely to get to participate again. Be friendly, be helpful, be an active participant - closing a question is an act from a non-participant, a passive member of the site, which a moderator cannot be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;There are many moderating activities that the someone who is not a Diamond Moderator can do such as voting, editing, flagging, and visiting the reviews queues. Visiting the reviews queues is the activity farthest removing from visiting the site simply to ask or answer questions. In the last year or two, how active have you been in the review queues? How do you see yourself fostering a helpful community of people with review queue privileges (who aren't mods)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been a consistent, active participant in the review cues as my privileges have been added. I am also an active participant in addressing questions and comments from newbies and welcoming them to the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What's the most helpful post/answer you've seen on this site? What makes it stand out as an exemplary post/answer?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will freely take credit for starting the trend of people starting posts to newbies with &quot;Welcome to the site!&quot;. I started doing that last year because I want to be helpful and all of us were once new to data science. So I like that others are using that same greeting now and anybody that chooses to start their post with that is amazing!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How do you ensure a community welcoming to new users while preventing a high number of low-quality questions?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is a low quality question? There really is no single way to quantify that. But we can certainly quantify how many people we lose with an unwelcoming reply to questions and we simply can't allow that to continue or this site will never grow. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What role do you see moderation playing in differentiating this site from stackexchange sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;ai.stackexchange&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;crossvalidated&lt;/a&gt; and what guidelines are you following to achieve it?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with the premise that we need guidelines for this. I think that those items will take care of themselves over the long term with any number of factors coming into play. For example, the AI SE is sponsored by IBM - in other words, that SE isn't going anywhere. There's simply too many items in play for any single person to do something about it. The only thing I can focus on is making Data Science the best SE possible and everything else will take care of itself in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators provide a combination of representation, leadership, mentoring, guidance and overall help. Yes, of course I'm willing to participate in the editing cues, just as I always have. But if a moderator isn't willing to accept the added roles that come with being selected then this site just isn't being properly served. I'm willing to be one of the leaders that will make this site grow as much as it can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="23240" LastActivityDate="2019-03-26T01:14:17.493" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For posts that blatantly display a lack of refined effort, clarity, or do not follow the guidelines for asking thoughtful questions, I believe immediate closure is appropriate. I also believe however, that users that make questions of salvageable quality should be encouraged to make edits and improvements or be put on hold (see my recent Meta comment about this). Overall, I would continue to vote to close posts which clearly stand out as unacceptable, but would leave others open to encourage improvement or to the discretion of democratic vote from other reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since this question seemed to place an emphasis on a quantitative component to this answer, I did the following calculations on my recent voting history for convenience:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;7% were Leave Open votes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;30% were Skip Post votes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;63% were Close votes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, most questions that populate the close queue arrived for a legitimate reason. So I don't see these statistics changing that much with moderator privileges, however, perhaps less closure votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;One of the most important responsibilities of a moderator is being on the site regularly.

Generally, at least once a day but sometimes up to three times a day. I also visit Stack Overflow as well just less frequently. I believe that being active as a moderator is critical to helping resolve issues promptly and keeping the site clean.

Either a question is exemplary in its spelling, phrasing, and clarity or not. Overall, I enjoy editing posts. In the last quarter, I edited 34 posts (I think this is a fairly significant number relative to the size of our site and frequency of new questions asked). I would edit more posts with immediate edit privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While thoughtful answers prove invaluable to the success of our site, they should not come at the expense of our basic Code of Conduct. Ultimately, everyone represents the site - especially those with high reputation.

If displays of rudeness or repeated flagging persisted, I would suggest enacting a temporary ban to further convey the importance of respectful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the moderators of a Stack Exchange forum all share unique expertise related to their respective forum. If a moderator decided to close a post that I disagreed with, I would respect their decision to do so. I would however, seek clarification as to why it was closed so that I could make any necessary edits or understand why the particular question was closed. Ultimately, moderators should trust the judgment of their peers but sometimes mistakes can happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;There are many moderating activities that the someone who is not a Diamond Moderator can do such as voting, editing, flagging, and visiting the reviews queues. Visiting the reviews queues is the activity farthest removing from visiting the site simply to ask or answer questions. In the last year or two, how active have you been in the review queues? How do you see yourself fostering a helpful community of people with review queue privileges (who aren't mods)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since gaining access to the review queues, I have been very active in them. Most frequently, I review posts in the close votes queue and the first post queue as these are often the most pressing to address in a timely manner. I also occasionally frequent the open vote queue and the late post queue, although admittedly, less than the other two. If there are any users which seem like they may be interested in participating in review tasks I would actively encourage them to explore them. Users who recently cross the reputation eligibility thresholds may also not be familiar with their access to the review sections; therefore, I would make sure to let them know about this feature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What's the most helpful post/answer you've seen on this site? What makes it stand out as an exemplary post/answer?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to pick a definitive favorite for a post/answer on this site however, two that stood out to me were the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/47267/what-is-the-most-efficient-method-for-hyperparameter-optimization-in-scikit-lear&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; by Brian. I like this question because it is clearly very well thought out. It also adds an explanatory preface, acknowledges current progress, and clearly states the question. Further, it asks for working code examples and benchmarks which could be useful to future readers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also like the top answer &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/6107/what-are-deconvolutional-layers&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; because it has very clear visualizations. Sometimes answers can be best expressed in pictures, animations, or formulas rather than always in text format. To me, answers which utilize each when appropriate greatly enhance their overall effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How do you ensure a community welcoming to new users while preventing a high number of low-quality questions?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best way to preserve a well maintained and welcoming community is to help new users learn how to craft high quality questions while simultaneously filtering out low quality questions. I believe that leaving comments like &quot;welcome to Stack Exchange Data Science, please consider adding more content to help better explain your question&quot; can be helpful for new users; but, for questions which are not appropriate for the site, even coming from a new user, they should be removed. This answer shares some similarity to Question 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What role do you see moderation playing in differentiating this site from stackexchange sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;ai.stackexchange&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;crossvalidated&lt;/a&gt; and what guidelines are you following to achieve it?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this site is similar in structure to other sites like Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange Data Science is unique in that it is much less developed. As a result, I believe that moderation for our site in particular, should be centered around fostering the growth and development of a community focused on generating exceptionally high quality content. Overall, this should be its largest distinguishing factor. I am not an expert on the specific protocol for Cross Validated, but to me, its has always seemed to be more focused on mathematical and statistical explanations to particular machine learning topics rather than broader conceptual explanations. Additionally, just from browsing its top tags, in comparison, it seems to place a greater emphasis on the use of regression based techniques and models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators uphold basic organization of a site in addition to mediating conflict. They should also act as leaders on the site. Beyond the tasks outlined in the elections post, moderators also work to maintain administrative aspects of the site such as review queues and cleanliness. They also act to be community leaders and ultimately lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29169" LastActivityDate="2019-03-26T05:30:07.670" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

As&#xA;  a moderator your close vote is binding. So, voting to close will close&#xA;  the question regardless of how the community at large has received the&#xA;  question. Many people think that closing questions is harsh and should&#xA;  only be used in the most extreme cases. Others think that closing&#xA;  questions that meet the closing guidelines is one of the main methods&#xA;  to keep question quality high. So this question centers on discussing&#xA;  how you will use your moderator close vote powers and how you have&#xA;  recently used the powers you currently have. Please discuss your views&#xA;  on this. Points that should be addressed include: How do you expect&#xA;  you will use the moderator close vote power? Will you visit the close&#xA;  vote queue regularly and vote to close those questions that need&#xA;  closing? How many close votes have you done in the last year? How many&#xA;  close vote reviews have you done in the last year? Do you consider&#xA;  closing a question unwelcoming?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mods have a sledgehammer privilege (as you mentioned), which means a question gets instantly closed, if we vote it close, irrespective of the number of close votes on it. &#xA;So, this is what I do: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the question is blatantly off-topic or code-only, I close it down. If it is a new user, I often leave a helpful comment&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If not, I would suggest edits which can make the question salvageable and leave it to the OP to accept or reject the edits. If they reject, then the question would be closed down. So, I believe in giving a chance for posts with salvageable quality.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recent data says I have 63% close votes and 37% do-not-close votes.&#xA;I dont consider cose votes as unwelcoming. It is a very crucial tool/part in site moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One of the most important responsibilities of a moderator is being on&#xA;  the site regularly. Moderators are expected to visit the site&#xA;  regularly and go to the moderator queues and then maybe also the&#xA;  review queues. How often do you visit DataScience or other&#xA;  StackExchange sites during a day or week?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd probably pack my laptop and go home if SO was down for a day. Jokes aside, I visit SO and DS site almost every day, unless on a vacation or some health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Effective moderation requires a desire to generate high quality&#xA;  content. One aspect of quality contcent is clear grammar and&#xA;  formatting. To that end, editing is an important activity. Please&#xA;  discuss how you approach the task of content editing. Some things to&#xA;  consider: How many edits have you done on the site (or on other SE&#xA;  sites) in the last year or two? How many suggested edits have you&#xA;  reviewed on the site (or on other SE sites) in the last year or two?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, edits are very important, so important that they can make a post salvageable, thereby helping users understand how to better structure their posts and ask better questions + I consider editing/contributing to tag descriptions also very important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of&#xA;  valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of&#xA;  arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A solution which worked for me was, taking them into a private chat and understanding their issues and trying to address them, and help them understand the Code of Conduct. Private chat, cause putting yourself in their shoes would help understand their behavior better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc&#xA;  a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Happens quite often than one might think. We have a chat group for mods. We take it up there. Again, tell your point of view, listen to their point of view. Then, decide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There are many moderating activities that the someone who is not a&#xA;  Diamond Moderator can do such as voting, editing, flagging, and&#xA;  visiting the reviews queues.

How do you see yourself fostering a helpful&#xA;  community of people with review queue privileges (who aren't mods)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My health has not been great throughout the last quarter, which didn't allow me a lot of internet time. However, I haven't seen any clogs or blockages in the review queues. This was when I was convinced that we have a very active, responsible community, who are more than willing to put their hand up and contribute to the review queues. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I keep receiving 'unhelpful' or 'abusive' flags by new users against active users, once in a while. In most such occasions, it was when an active user gives suggestions like:  'Please go read the theory before trying to implementing' (which I concur 'cause with the hype of ML and data science, new comers tend to dive into implementation before understanding theory, which isn't very helpful for them), so very few such flags were held valid in our site's history, which again speaks for the welcoming nature of our site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What's the most helpful post/answer you've seen on this site? What&#xA;  makes it stand out as an exemplary post/answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/8252/11097&quot;&gt;This is my favorite answer&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because, it is still one of the best explanations for explaining columnar databases + the way Franck explained it with pictures, which helps understand the text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we are looking for a recent such example, then have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/47160/11097&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;. Such a good explanation. An instant delight for the OP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How do you ensure a community welcoming to new users while preventing&#xA;  a high number of low-quality questions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One cannot expect the low-quality traffic to decrease while the popularity and size of the site increase. We should continue doing a good job with the review queues and moderation in general, so that we keep weeding out the low-quality posts and ensure having high quality traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What role do you see moderation playing in differentiating this site&#xA;  from stackexchange sites like stackoverflow, ai.stackexchange or&#xA;  crossvalidated and what guidelines are you following to achieve it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ref to my response of the difference between the sites: &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/266996/302377&quot;&gt;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/266996/302377&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see a huge difference between moderation styles for these sites. Except that, CV and DS have very clear off-topic boundaries, but AI doesn't. So, that'd be a problem while scaling up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators are users who are elected by the community to deal with situations which are disruptive in nature, like a clash of opinions, abusive/rude behavior, etc. In addition, they work along with the regular contributors in keeping the site sane and welcoming for new users and new posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="11097" LastEditorUserId="11097" LastEditDate="2019-03-26T10:37:49.330" LastActivityDate="2019-03-26T10:37:49.330" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

However, I think it is important that low quality questions are closed consistently and also quickly. For first time questions, I try to leave comments that explain the reasoning or could help reopen the question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most questions that get closed are either too broad or are not well researched. I think it is now accepted among most active users that these questions should be closed, see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2414/23305&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it is important to remain consistent. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other questions are just very simple and could be quickly resolved by an online search. In my opinion, these questions should also be closed quickly because they attract activity (&quot;easy reputation&quot;) that dilutes what separates this SE from other sites and makes this SE less attractive by setting bad examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I reviewed 487 close votes so far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;One of the most important responsibilities of a moderator is being on the site regularly.

I approve even small edits to grammar. I don't think it is offensive as long as it contributes to a higher chance of encouraging a response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I reviewed 337 suggested edits so far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see this as a big problem on this SE (so far) but I would try to approach the person in a private chat. If no solution can be found, good content should not give a free pass to comments that are offensive and continue to violate the site's standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would encourage the mod to share her reasoning with the user so the question can be edited accordingly (if possible).

If there seems to accumulate a backlog of review tasks I would raise the issue with the community and ask for their support.

Of course, there are questions that don't have a place in a Stack Exchange site, but others that don't meet the rules 100%, however, they have an added value for those that will visit the site later. In 2019, I have 6 closing votes (with 16 in total), but in most of the times, I prefer to leave a comment and give the chance to the OP to improve the question, rather than close it without a warning.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;One of the most important responsibilities of a moderator is being on the site regularly.

Visiting the reviews queues is the activity farthest removing from visiting the site simply to ask or answer questions. In the last year or two, how active have you been in the review queues? How do you see yourself fostering a helpful community of people with review queue privileges (who aren't mods)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In StackExchange in total, I had more than 250 review actions. I don't see any other way to engange the community on the review process rather than asking on the comments section, on chat and on Meta. I believe, mention that they can contribute here with only a few minutes every once, is the most safe solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What's the most helpful post/answer you've seen on this site? What makes it stand out as an exemplary post/answer?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to find one question and answer. Nevertheless, the question I liked a lot is this one &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/130/what-is-dimensionality-reduction-what-is-the-difference-between-feature-selecti&quot;&gt;What is dimensionality reduction? What is the difference between feature selection and extraction?&lt;/a&gt;. I am a Data Science Workshop Instructor and I hear this question almost every time. As for an answer, I like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/27891/201&quot;&gt;Imbalanced data causing mis-classification on multiclass dataset&lt;/a&gt; because it combines a little bit of theory, code and practical, real-life hints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How do you ensure a community welcoming to new users while preventing a high number of low-quality questions?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also similar to my closing approach. If users see that an official moderator asks from a newcomer to improve his question, maybe with some suggestions, they might tend to do the same. I was always against the aggressive behaviour of voting down without giving a feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What role do you see moderation playing in differentiating this site from stackexchange sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;ai.stackexchange&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;crossvalidated&lt;/a&gt; and what guidelines are you following to achieve it?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was super active in Open Data, I used to take a short &quot;walk&quot; on similar SE to find questions that might fit better on Open Data. Was also my way to promote that site. However, the difference in DS, AI and CV is too thin. If it was in my decision, I wouldn't have all 3 of them. But since it's not, my intention is to keep any question that is relevant to DS here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, moderators represent the community. If they always overreact, then the community will do the same. If they are not active, the community will do the same. They are not Grammar Nazis, but people that love what they do and want to help each others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="201" LastActivityDate="2019-03-31T17:55:55.203" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

As a moderator your close vote is binding. So, voting to close will close the question regardless of how the community at large has received the question. Many people think that closing questions is harsh and should only be used in the most extreme cases. Others think that closing questions that meet the closing guidelines is one of the main methods to keep question quality high. So this question centers on discussing how you will use your moderator close vote powers and how you have recently used the powers you currently have. Please discuss your views on this. Points that should be addressed include: How do you expect you will use the moderator close vote power? Will you visit the close vote queue regularly and vote to close those questions that need closing? How many close votes have you done in the last year? How many close vote reviews have you done in the last year? Do you consider closing a question unwelcoming?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I prefer to think that there are two paths: (1) putting a question on hold temporarily; (2) closing a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal of putting a question on hold is not to shut it down forever, but to put it on pause to give the poster a chance to address feedback or clarify the question.  I think that many questions can be handled through this path.  In particular, the path I see is to put a question on hold, and leave a comment explaining how the question can be improved and that the decision can be reconsidered once the feedback is addressed.  The idea is to give the poster guidance on how to make their question suitable and share our community's norms and expectations.  Assuming the original poster returns to revise their question, it can be re-opened once it is clarified.  So the goal and hope is that this leads to a question that is ultimately open, not closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closing a question is necessary in some cases, where no amount of changes can make the question suitable -- e.g., where it is simply off-topic.  But my experience is that the majority of cases are better handled by the &quot;on hold&quot; process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we can put questions on hold while being welcoming.  There is some data to suggest that one of the most discouraging responses is radio silence, where the poster receives no response or engagement.  I suspect constructive feedback is far better than silence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in short, I suspect some of the discontent about closing questions can be addressed by using the &quot;on hold&quot; process.  Of course, the underlying mechanism we have (vote to close) may look the same for both, but we can explain the difference in comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I expect that I'd only use moderator powers to close a question unilaterally when I am sure it is unsuitable.  Otherwise, I'd leave a comment (e.g., &quot;this looks like it might be too broad to fit our site format; any community votes?&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;One of the most important responsibilities of a moderator is being on the site regularly. Moderators are expected to visit the site regularly and go to the moderator queues and then maybe also the review queues. How often do you visit DataScience or other StackExchange sites during a day or week?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I usually visit Stack Exchange about once a day.  I'd expect to visit Data Science at least every other day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Effective moderation requires a desire to generate high quality content. One aspect of quality content is clear grammar and formatting. To that end, editing is an important activity. Please discuss how you approach the task of content editing. Some things to consider: How many edits have you done on the site (or on other SE sites) in the last year or two? How many suggested edits have you reviewed on the site (or on other SE sites) in the last year or two?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree.  I regularly edit questions and answers.  I usually also try to leave a comment, to teach the poster about our expectations, in the hopes that they will learn to do this themselves in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've made &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/users/8560/d-w?tab=activity&amp;amp;sort=revisions&quot;&gt;27 edits on Data Science.SE&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/755/d-w?tab=activity&amp;amp;sort=revisions&quot;&gt;2,487 edits on CS.SE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This requires looking at the nature of the arguments and flags.  If the user is rude or violating our be nice rules, they need a mod message or suspension explaining our requirements to participate on the site; those rules are mandatory, and producing a steady stream of valuable answers does not provide a &quot;get out of jail&quot; card.  However, I also recognize that just because someone receives many flags does not necessarily mean their behavior is problematic.   Flags are a signal to look closer, not a basis for drawing conclusions in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd either chalk it up to a learning experience and try to learn from them about site standards, or I'd talk to them about it. I would not unilaterally override another moderator's decision without talking to the team about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;There are many moderating activities that the someone who is not a Diamond Moderator can do such as voting, editing, flagging, and visiting the reviews queues.

Moderators hopefully provide leadership, by setting a good example -- this is the soft side of moderation, and it is arguably as important as the day-to-day handling of flags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What role do you see moderation playing in differentiating this site from stackexchange sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;ai.stackexchange&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;crossvalidated&lt;/a&gt; and what guidelines are you following to achieve it?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is obviously a significant amount of overlap between these sites, and a healthy debate about their relationship.

I am not generally &quot;harsh&quot; on questioners and want to be helpful to beginners, but if they can't even take the time to formulate a well-written complete question with context and details in proper English, then why should anyone take the time to answer it?

The latter is not likely to garner much use as older versions become superannuated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More explicitly - I do not think having a separate tag for versions makes the most sense as likely almost all questions asked at this time will be included in this subset as you mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status Update 11/25/22:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/orange3&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange3&amp;#39;&quot; aria-label=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange3&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;orange3-container&quot;&gt;orange3&lt;/a&gt; tag has officially been removed. &lt;strong&gt;Why was this done?&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to the many great points outlined above, here are some quick reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no distinction between versions on the larger site Stack Overflow (there is just one tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/orange&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;&quot; aria-label=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;orange-container&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was less site-wide interest in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/orange3&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange3&amp;#39;&quot; aria-label=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange3&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;orange3-container&quot;&gt;orange3&lt;/a&gt; tag compared to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/orange&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;&quot; aria-label=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;orange-container&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt; tag (only 5 watchers compared to the 44 on the more general tag)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is enough semantic similarity between both of these tags that there is no real reason to have the distinction (most questions on Orange just simply included both tags)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any question about Orange is likely implicitly referring to Orange 3+ as older versions have been superannuated (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/biolab/orange3/releases?page=4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;earliest release of Orange&lt;/a&gt; on its GitHub page is for version 3.1 and was released on Nov 10, 2014)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were relatively little usage of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/orange3&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange3&amp;#39;&quot; aria-label=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange3&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;orange3-container&quot;&gt;orange3&lt;/a&gt; tag relative to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/orange&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;&quot; aria-label=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;orange-container&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt; tag (10 questions asked this year compared to 29 on the main tag)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29169" LastEditorUserId="29169" LastEditDate="2022-09-25T15:09:24.837" LastActivityDate="2022-09-25T15:09:24.837" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

  <row Id="2639" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2637" CreationDate="2023-01-11T13:02:48.153" Score="5" Body="&lt;p&gt;ACL has recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/ACL-2023-policy/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;their take&lt;/a&gt; on the topic which I find well thought-through and sufficiently nuanced (in contrast to an undifferentiated strict ban, for example). While ACL is certainly a different platform than DSSE and, hence, facing different potential issues with regards to Large Language Models (LLMs), I still think these rules could be mostly adopted for DSSE:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assistance purely with the language of the paper&lt;/strong&gt;. When generative models are used for paraphrasing or polishing the author’s original content, rather than for suggesting new content - they are similar to tools like Grammarly, spell checkers, dictionary and synonym tools, which have all been perfectly acceptable for years. If the authors are not sufficiently fluent to notice when the generated output does not match their intended ideas, using such tools without further checking could yield worse results than simpler-but-more-accurate English. The use of tools that only assist with language, like Grammarly or spell checkers, does not need to be disclosed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-form input assistance&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though predictive keyboards or tools like smart compose in google docs are also powered by generative language models, nobody objected to them, since hardly anyone would try to use them to generate a long, unique and coherent text: it would simply not be practical. Similarly to language tools above, the use of such tools does not need to be disclosed in response to the writing assistance question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature search&lt;/strong&gt;. Generative text models may be used as search assistants, e.g. to identify relevant literature. However, we expect the authors to read and discuss such references, just like the references identified by a regular search engine or a semantic literature recommendation tool. The usual requirements for citation accuracy and thoroughness of literature reviews apply; beware of the possible biases in suggested citations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-novelty text&lt;/strong&gt;. Some authors may feel that describing widely known concepts is a waste of their time and can be automated. They should specify where such text was used, and convince the reviewers that the generation was checked to be accurate and is accompanied by relevant and appropriate citations (e.g., using block quotes for verbatim copying). If the generation copies text verbatim from existing work, the authors need to acknowledge all relevant citations: both the source of the text used and the source of the idea(s).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New ideas&lt;/strong&gt;. In cases where the model suggested new research ideas that would deserve co-authorship or acknowledgement from a human colleague, and which you then developed yourself (e.g. topics to discuss, framing of the problem) - we would suggest acknowledging the use of the model, and checking whether there are known sources for any ideas that are not widely known, or that you would not have included but for the help of the model.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New ideas + new text&lt;/strong&gt;: a contributor of both ideas and their execution seems to us like the definition of a co-author, which the models cannot be. While the norms around the use of generative AI in research are being established, we would discourage such use in ACL submissions. If you choose to go down this road, you are welcome to make the case to the reviewers that this should be allowed, and that the new content is in fact correct, coherent, original and does not have missing citations. Note that, as our colleagues at ICML point out, currently it is not even clear who should take the credit for the generated text: the developers of the model, the authors of the training data, or the user who generated it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An argument for stricter rules on DSSE might be that most answers are low-novelty since this is a not site to publish novel research. However, I suggest to still treat text generated by LLMs, such as ChatGPT, like another source, e.g. Wikipedia, and require users to explicitly quote it. The downside of this approach is that in contrast to sources like a website the references cannot be validated. To manage that problem we could require users to include the prompt they used. (Though I am unsure what level of compliance we can expect here.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides answers in natural language, rules also need to cover code. ACL states the following with regards to code:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A separate, but related issue is use of generative models for writing code. ACL submissions may be accompanied by code, which counts as supplementary materials that the reviewers are not obliged to check and consider, but they may do so if they wish. The use of code assistants such as Copilot is also a relatively new practice, and the norms around that are not fully established. For now, we ask the authors to acknowledge the use of such systems and the scope thereof, e.g. in the README files accompanying the code attachments or repositories. We also ask the authors to check for potential plagiarism. Note that the Copilot in particular is currently the subject of a piracy lawsuit, and may have suggested snippets of code with licenses incompatible with yours. The use of code assistance does not obviate the requirements of authors to ensure the correctness of their methods and results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, since purely coding related questions are out of scope for DSSE anyhow, I do not think we need strict restrictions with regards to code, except for a comment in case the code was completely generated by an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally and on the softer side of arguments, I think as a site on which LLMs are on-topic, we need to be open to the innovation our field brings to the table. And if these rules lead to problems, these could be fixed by an re-evaluation of whatever is decided now (e.g. in 3 to 6 months).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84891" LastEditorUserId="84891" LastEditDate="2023-01-11T13:09:09.263" LastActivityDate="2023-01-11T13:09:09.263" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />
